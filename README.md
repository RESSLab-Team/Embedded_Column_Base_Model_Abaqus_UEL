# DESCRIPTION

ECB_UEL.for is user-defined element (UEL) that is used to model the cyclic behavior of an embedded column base (ECB). 

Column_ECB_Model.inp is an abaqus input file used to run a mixed dimension continuum finite element model of an embedded column base connection under the cyclic symmetric loading protocol. This is the model validated to an ECB connection test (specimen #4) from Grilli et. al (2017). The model is built using Abaqus Standard v6.14. 
Details of the modeling approach are found in Inamasu (2021) and Inamasu et al. (2021).
